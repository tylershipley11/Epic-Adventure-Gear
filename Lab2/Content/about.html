        <section id="history">
            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p><em>Epic Adventure Gear</em> was born out of founder Jake Lawsonâ€™s
                lifelong love for the outdoors. As a
                kid
                growing up
                in the Colorado Rockies, Jake spent his days hiking trails, fishing
                in mountain streams, and camping
                under
                the stars. He quickly realized that having the right gear can make or
                break an adventure. <br><br>
                After years of using subpar equipment, Jake decided to create a
                business that offers adventurers
                reliable,
                high-quality products they can trust. Starting with a small pop-up
                tent at local outdoor expos, Epic
                Adventure Gear has grown into a thriving business that equips
                explorers across the nation. <br><br>
                Today, Jake and his team remain dedicated to their mission: to
                inspire others to get outside, explore,
                and
                experience the beauty of nature.
